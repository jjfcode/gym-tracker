# Supabase Database Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the Supabase database for the Gym Tracker application.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
- Node.js and npm installed
- The Gym Tracker project cloned and dependencies installed

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization
4. Fill in project details:
   - **Name**: `gym-tracker` (or your preferred name)
   - **Database Password**: Choose a strong password
   - **Region**: Select the region closest to your users
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait for the project to be fully provisioned (this can take a few minutes)

## Step 2: Get Your Project Credentials

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to **Settings** > **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`)
   - **service_role** key (also starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9` but is different)

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. In the `gym-tracker-app` directory, copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and replace the placeholder values:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
   ```

3. Save the file

## Step 4: Set Up Database Schema

### Option A: Manual Setup (Recommended)

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Open the file `gym-tracker-app/supabase/schema.sql` in your code editor
3. Copy the entire contents of the file
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor in Supabase
5. Click **Run** to execute the SQL
6. Verify that all tables were created by going to **Table Editor**

You should see these tables:
- `profile`
- `weight_logs` 
- `plans`
- `workouts`
- `exercises`
- `exercise_sets`

### Option B: Automated Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer to use the automated setup script:

```bash
npm run setup:database
```

Note: This requires the service role key to be configured in your environment.

## Step 5: Verify Setup

Run the database test to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
npm run test:database
```

You should see output like:
```
ðŸ“Š Database Setup Status
========================
Status: âœ… Success
Message: Database setup is complete and working correctly

Details:
- Tables exist: âœ…
- RLS enabled: âœ…
- Indexes created: âœ…
```

## Step 6: Test the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. The application should now be able to connect to your Supabase database

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing Supabase environment variables" error:**
- Make sure your `.env.local` file exists and has the correct variable names
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

**"Database connection failed" error:**
- Verify your project URL and anon key are correct
- Make sure your Supabase project is fully provisioned
- Check that you're using the correct region URL

**"Table does not exist" errors:**
- Make sure you ran the complete schema.sql file
- Check the Table Editor in Supabase to verify tables were created
- Ensure there were no SQL errors during schema execution

**RLS (Row Level Security) errors:**
- This is expected behavior when not authenticated
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data
- The application will handle authentication properly

### Manual Verification Steps

1. **Check Tables**: Go to Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor
   - All 6 tables should be visible
   - Each table should show "RLS enabled"

2. **Check Policies**: Go to Authentication > Policies
   - Each table should have multiple policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Policies should be named like "Users can view own [table]"

3. **Check Indexes**: Go to Database > Indexes
   - You should see multiple indexes for performance optimization

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env.local` file** - it contains sensitive credentials
- The **service role key** has admin access - only use it for setup
- The **anon key** is safe to use in client-side code
- All user data is protected by Row Level Security (RLS)

## Next Steps

Once your database is set up and tested:

1. âœ… Database schema created
2. âœ… Environment variables configured  
3. âœ… Connection tested
4. ðŸ”„ Ready to implement authentication (Task 4)
5. ðŸ”„ Ready to build UI components (Task 3)

Your Supabase database is now ready for the Gym Tracker application! ðŸŽ‰
